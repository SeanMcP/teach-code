> CodeSandbox is an online development environment that helps you create web applications, from prototype to deployment. It is one of my favorite tools for front-end development and a valuable resources for junior and senior devs alike. Let's do a search for "CodeSandbox" and check it out.

Search "CodeSandbox and clicks on the link

> CodeSandbox has been in development since December of 2016, but has really ramped over the past year some awesome features. But at its core, CodeSandbox allows you to quickly bootstrap projects and start coding.

Highlight different project options

> You can see that we can spin up a React project, Angular, Vue, or vanilla JavaScript with Parcel, all with the click of a button. For this tour, we're going to be looking at React, so let's select the blue cube and click "Open React."

Select the blue cube and click on "Open React"

Gesture towards each section

> After taking a moment to load, you're brought to your development environment. You can see in the left-hand panel we have a file navigator, then here in the center we have our text editor, and finally on the right we can see a live browser preview of our code.

Change "CodeSandbox" to "YouTube"

> If we make any changes in the text editor, you will see them appear almost instantly in the preview.

Wait for preview to update

> Voila; live reloading!

Highlight and select each button

> But we aren't limited to a preview. With these buttons in the top-right-hand corner, we can toggle between the preview, console, and tests views. You can also minimize the right panel to give yourself more room for the text editor.
