> Hey, my name is Sean, and I am a software developer. That means I get to work with computers to solve problems everyday. I love making stuff, learning skills, and working to make peoples' lives easier. I really love my work.

CUT

> But it wasn't always that way. I went to college to be a teacher. Growing up, my dad was a high-school chemistry teacher, and I got to see the wonderful impact that he had on his students and our community. I wanted to be like him; I wanted to become a teacher so that I could help make the world a better place.

> After four years, I graduated with a degree in middle-level education and worked for three years as a teacher in Pennsylvania and Georgia. But it just wasn't a good fit. *I* wasn't a good fit.

CUT

> So, I resigned after the 2016-2017 school year and enrolled in a coding bootcamp. Six months and a lot of hard work later, I received an offer for my first software developer position -- this job that I mentioned at the beginning.

> The starting salary exceeded my previous teacher's salary and the coding bootcamp's tuition... combined. Six months of work and I was able to change my life. It all seemed so easy.

CUT

> And, from the outside, it was that easy. People I meet, either at work or friends, can't believe how quickly things changed for me. But the view from the outside is only half the story... if that.

CUT

> The whole story is that I've been playing around with computers since I was little. I made my first website when I was twelve, and, by high school, I had created my first company: a web design and development agency with a classmate.

> Through college, I coded on and off, usually over the summers. I enjoyed the creative outlet and challenge that comes from learning to do new things with computers. So when I decided to leave the teaching, it was only natural to pursue coding.

> The coding bootcamp I attended helped me solidify and expand on the skills I had already developed when I was younger. When I started my first development position, I wasn't a fresh "graduate" who had only been coding for a few months; I had over a decade of assorted coding experience under my belt. That's the whole story.

CUT

> That was the secret to my success: experience. But that's not necessarily the case for everyone. Now there are plenty of coding bootcamp graduates who had no prior experience and went on to have successful careers as developers.
