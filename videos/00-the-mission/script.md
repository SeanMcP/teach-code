INTRODUCTION

Learn to Code with Sean McP

CUT

> My name is Sean, and I am a software developer. That means I get to work with computers and solve problems everyday.

> I love making stuff, learning skills, and working to make peoples' lives easier. At my job, I get to do all these things; and it's pretty great. But I haven't always been a developer.

CUT

> In fact, went to college to study education and worked for three years as a teacher in Pennsylvania and Georgia. I learned a lot about collaboration and problem solving and gained a huge appreciation for the hard work that teachers do every day.

CUT

> Seriously, teaching takes a ton of work and dedication; they're awesome. Go hug a teacher in your life.

CUT

> Now, I want to try to combine my two careers: teaching and developing. My goal for this channel -- the one you're watching right now -- is to provide instructional videos for folks of all ages to learn to code.

> All of my videos will use online resources that are available to anyone with a computer and internet connection. You wont't need to install anything to participate. So it doesn't matter if you're on a Chromebook, laptop, or anything in between; these videos will work for you. Just make sure you have a keyboard to type along.

CUT

> It's my hope that teachers will be able to use these videos to introduce their students to code. Or maybe you're out of school and watching this, and you want to make a career switch -- like I did. These videos will work for you too.

CUT

> Ultimately, my goal is to help other people; so let me know in the comments of this video if there is anything you would like help learning. Let's do it together!

CUT

> That's all for this video. Stay tuned for the first lesson which should come out shortly.

> Until then, happy coding!
